# Entity types (Version 2)
{: #entity-types-version-2}

The following tables list the entity types and subtypes that are used in the _Version 2_ entity type system.
{: shortdesc}

The entity type system that {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} uses differs based on which version date and which language you are using. For more details, see the [Entity type systems](/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-entity-type-systems) page. For information about available enrichments, see [Adding enrichments](/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-configservice#adding-enrichments).

## Entity subtypes
{: #subtypes-version-2}
