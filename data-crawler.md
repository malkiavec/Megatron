# Adding content with Data Crawler

The data crawler lets you automate the upload of content to the {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} Service.
{: shortdesc}

## Crawling data with the Data Crawler

The Data Crawler is a command line tool that will help you take your documents from the repositories where they reside (for example: file shares, databases, Microsoft SharePoint&reg; ) and push them to the cloud, to be used by the {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} Service.

## When to use the Data Crawler

The Data Crawler should be used if you want to have a managed upload of a significant number of files from a remote system, or you want to extract content from a supported repository (such as a DB2 database).

The Data Crawler is not intended to be a solution for uploading files from your local drive. Uploading files from a local drive should be done using the tooling or by using direct API calls.
