# Parsing contracts
{: #contract_parsing}

Element Classification returns parsed contracts with an analysis of each identified element.

The following sections describe how the returned JSON provides the analysis.

## Types
{: #contract_types}

The `types` array includes a number of objects, each of which contains `nature` and `party` keys whose values identify a couplet for the element.

The following tables list the possible values of the `nature` and `party` keys.

| `nature`         |Description                                                |
|:----------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|`Definition`      |This element adds clarity for a term, relationship, or similar. No action is required to fulfill the element, nor is any party affected.|
|`Disclaimer`      |The `party` in the element is not obligated to fulfill the terms specified by the element but is not prohibited from doing so.|
|`Exclusion`       |The `party` in the element will not fulfill the terms specified by the element.|
|`Obligation`      |The `party` in the element is required to fulfill the terms specified by the element.|
|`Right`           |The `party` in the element is guaranteed to receive the terms specified by the element.|

Each `nature` key is paired with a `party` key, which will contain either the name or the role of the party or parties that apply to the nature (examples include, but are not limited to, `Buyer`, `IBM`, or `All Parties`). Note that for the `Definition` nature, the party is always `None`.

## Parties
{: #contract_parties}

The separate `parties` array specifies the participants listed in the contract. Each identified `party` object lists the identified party by name and is matched with a `role` that classifies the role of the `party` object. The values of `role` that can be returned for contracts include, but are not limited to:

| `role`           |Description                                                |
|:----------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|`Buyer`           |The party responsible for paying for the goods or services listed in the contract.|
|`End User`        |The party who will interact with the provided goods or services, explicitly distinguished from the `Buyer`.|
|`None`            |No party was identified for the element.|
|`Supplier`        |The party responsible for providing the goods or services listed in the contract.|

## Categories
{: #contract_categories}

The `attributes` array specifies any attributes identified in the sentence. Each object in the array includes three keys: `type` (the type of attribute from the following table), `text` (the applicable text), and `location` (the `begin` and `end` indexes of the attribute in the input document). Currently supported attributes include:

| `attributes`     |Description                                                |

## Provenance
{: #provenance}

Each object in the `types` and `categories` arrays includes a `provenance_ids` array. The `provenance_ids` array has one or more keys. Each key is a hashed value that you can send to IBM to provide feedback or receive support.
